# pyselect

Source code for the `RFFNet` method and scripts to evaluate `RFFNet` in synthetic and real-world datasets.

## Setup

To reproduce the results, create a new `conda` environment using the `setup/pyselect_env.yml` file. Installation of `pyselect` should proceed using the `setup/*.whl` file. Data can be downloaded, processed, and splitted using scripts in the `scripts/` folder. The scripts to run each experiment are available in the `experiments/` folder.
